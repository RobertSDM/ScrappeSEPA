# Scrapper to get information about SEPA events

This is a scrapper built in python, to get information about events and papers from SEPA Power.

The scrapping using `selenium webdriver` to access the pages and `beautifulsoup` to extract the content

# Use of AI

Some pages don't have a standard or a meaningful tags to extract content from. \
In this cases the use of AI comes handy. In this project I used it to extract authors names from text presented in the site.

The AI I've used for this project was the `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, this model is hosted in [groq](https://groq.com/) cloud.
